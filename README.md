# Doubly-linked-list
Introduction:
The implementation of this doubly linked list demonstrates how data can be connected in a two-way direction.

Information:
1. Doubly linked list is a linear list that can traverse in both direction.
2. The datas that can be stored in the list is dependant on the template of node.
3. Variety of data type can be store in a node which forms a list ccreated using singly linked list.
4. The advantage of doubly linked list is the ability to return to previous node which removes the necessity to include extra pointers.
